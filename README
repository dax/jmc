Installation :

- Get pyxmpp from http://pyxmpp.jabberstudio.org/ (work with snapshot pyxmpp-0.5.s20050506)

- edit jmc.xml to match jabber server configuration :
	- for jabberd2, port must match router.xml port
	- for ejabberd, add new listening port :
	  {5347, ejabberd_service, [{access, all},
                            {host, "jmc.localhost",
                             [{password, "secret"}]}]}

- then run python jmc.py -c jmc.xml (-D to get debug)

Usage :

- Now you can register new mail server connection with your favorite
jabber client.
- all connection are then listed under your service browser and you
can edit mail server parameters by registering on listed connection.
